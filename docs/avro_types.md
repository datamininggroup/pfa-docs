## Not written yet

FIXME: write about Avro types from the point of view of PFA documents.

For the time being, see the [PFA specification](http://github.com/scoringengine/pfa/blob/master/pfa-specification.pdf?raw=true), which can serve as a reference (for PFA document authors) although it was written as a normative standard (for PFA implementers).
