## Not written yet

FIXME: create a list of PFA functions, their signatures, and their meaning.  This will largely be auto-generated documentation from XML fragments in the code (just like the specification LaTeX).

For the time being, see version 0.1 of the [PFA specification](http://github.com/scoringengine/pfa/blob/master/pfa-specification.pdf?raw=true), which can serve as a reference (for PFA document authors) although it was written as a normative standard (for PFA implementers).
