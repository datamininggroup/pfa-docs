FIXME: write about the structure of a PFA document.

For the time being, see version 0.1 of the [PFA specification](https://github.com/scoringengine/pfa/blob/master/doc/spec/PFA.pdf?raw=true), which can serve as a reference (for PFA document authors) although it was written as a normative standard (for PFA implementers).
